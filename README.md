# UnoHKMods
Random Hollow Knight mods I'm working on.

## ToggleableBindings
Lets you toggle on and off bindings at any point in-game with a handy UI. Contains an API for creating custom bindings and registering them so they too can be applied and restored at will.

## UnoHKUtils
Random helper library that I'm not sure I'll end up actually distributing as a .dll (if, y'know, I do decide to actually *release* anything in the first place) as I'd rather not add *yet another* dependency.
